## Computer Science

**Computer Science**, or the study of computers and computational systems, is an invaluable skill for a developer. A baseline knowledge of computer science fundamentals will greatly improve your skills as a developer and the efficiency of you algorithms. Additionally, these concepts are common fodder for coding interviews, so studying computer science will greatly improve your chances in an interview. Broadly, computer science can be broken down into two major topics: algorithms and data structures.      

An **Algorithm** is simply a set of instructions that need to be followed in order to solve a problem. While anything from a recipe to furniture building instructions can be considered an algorithm, typically the word is used to refer to a set of instructions given to a computer to solve a problem. 

**Data Structures** are ways of storing data efficiently and practically for use by the application. These are non-opinionated and built on primitive data types like booleans and numbers. 

When creating solutions to your problems, one of the most important considerations is algorithmic **efficiency**. In a computer science context, when talking about efficiency, we are usually talking about how long it takes our code to run, a concept known as **time complexity**, which we can quickly express using shorthand called **Big O Notation**.

Additionally, there are several ways of organizing your programs in an efficient manner, known as **paradigms**. **Functional Programming** is one common coding paradigm, wherein your code is built as a series of functions that take in input and return output. In JavaScript, we can implement functional patterns via the use of **closures**, or functions that return other functions and the scope in which they are created.
