Computer science forms the foundation upon which everything we build is built. By increasing our knowledge of computer science, we therefore increase our understanding of the underlying principles of all software, making us better, more efficient developers.

Looking for more information on Computer Science? Explore the following resources:

## Computer Science Fundamentals

* W3 Schools has a nice overview of [data structures and algorithms](https://www.w3schools.com/dsa/dsa_intro.php), offering a gentle introduction to all kinds of data structures.

* If you prefer books, [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/) by Gayle Laakmann McDowell is a fantastic choice. The book contains detailed sections on all major data structures and dozens of interview style algorithm questions with detailed solutions and explanations. Every hiring manager has a copy of this book on their desks, and the problems within often appear in technical interviews.

* [Design patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns) are yet another powerful tool for keeping your code structured and organized, and this deep dive will make you an expert in the topic.

## Visualizations

Visualizations are great for reinforcing tricky computer science concepts. Here are a few examples:

* [VisualGo] (https://visualgo.net/en) includes wonderful interactive visualizations of data structures and sorting algorithms.

* For searching algorithms, [this visualizer](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Search.html) from the University of San Francisco is a wonderful interactive tool for a deeper understanding of both linear and binary searches.

* Finally, on a lighter note, the [AlgoRythmics](https://www.youtube.com/@AlgoRythmics/videos) use traditional folk dances to demonstrate sorting and searching algorithms.

## Algorithm Practice

As part of your interviews, you will be expected to solve algorithm problems. These sites are great for practice:

* [CodeSignal] (https://codesignal.com/) is a great first step for interview prep, their platform includes a curated progression of algorithm problems with a smooth difficulty curve and easy onboarding.

* For the more competitive types, [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/) includes leaderboards and social features so you can compete with your friends and colleagues. 

* [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) is the de facto industry standard for coding problems. Most of the actual problems you will see in coding interview will either come directly from these problems or be slightly modified from these problems.
