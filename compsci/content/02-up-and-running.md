## Getting Ready

This section contains a list of the tools you'll use in this module. For any new tools, you don't need to install them before you begin&mdash;you'll do that during the lessons. 

You'll use the following tools in this module:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is an open source integrated development environment (IDE) which allows us to both create and run our code all in one place. We will use Visual Studio Code, known colloquially as VSCode, to write all of the code for our applications. 

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows us to run JavaScript outside of the browser. This allows us to use JavaScript for non-traditional purposes, such as command line applications and web servers.

* [GitHub](https://github.com/) is the de facto standard for hosting git repositories online.  We will use GitHub to store and host all of our coding projects.
